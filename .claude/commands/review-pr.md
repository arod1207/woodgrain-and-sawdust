Review my current git changes as if you were a strict code reviewer.

Run `git diff main...HEAD` and check for:

- Bugs or logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- TypeScript type safety issues
- Missing error handling
- Performance problems
- Anything that would fail a code review

Be specific about file names and line numbers.
